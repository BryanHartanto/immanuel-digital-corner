## Introduction
Immanuel Digital Corner is an application created to facilitate communication between students, teachers and parents in the school environment.

With the creation of this application, it is hoped that in the future communication between the school and the students will become clearer, more effective and definitely more instant.
## About
The Immanuel Digital Corner application was formed on the creative ideas of 12th grade TKJ 3 children from Immanuel 1 Pontianak Christian Vocational High School.

Thanks to the guidance of the teachers as well as the cohesiveness of the Front End and Back End teams, application alignment can be created for the efficiency of all target users of the Immanuel Digital Corner application.
